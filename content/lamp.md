# 2025 LAMP Mission Trip

This summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to the First Nation community of Easterville, Manitoba and assist in running a VBS there for the local children. 
The entire trip was a filled with a lot of unknowns from the very beginning, as communication with the community was very limited, and were were unsure of what to expect. 
Over the past few months, wildfires had been raging across the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and as you may recall, the smoke from those wildfires had made it down to even the southern parts of the States. 
If you thought that was bad down south, you should have seen up north. While we were driving up north through Manitoba, we could see so much fire damage along the side of the roads, both from last year's burns, and the ones in the recent months. 
Thankfully, by both the grace of God and the hard work of the firefighters, the fires were mostly under control by the time we arrived. The air quality was a very refreshing 17, but there was still very visible recent burn damage on the outskirts of the community. 


Mail service to the community was also very limited, so we had to carry all of our supplies with us in two minivans. In May, we had sent a handful of promotional posters in order for the local reverend to put up. Due to a mail mishap and just very spotty mail coverage up north, we did not recieve the posters until the second day that we were there. Those posters took almost _two months_ to arrive, and had been sent via first class mail.

It was a two day drive up to Easterville, and we arrived in the evening of the second day. We unpacked our stuff and headed down to the only store in town, the co-op. There, we were greeted by some of the local children who were excited to see the people who they had meet last year. 
With the assistance of the reverend and the band leader, we were able to drum up support amongst the local community members. Last year, we had barely broken 25 kids at our VBS. This year, we had planned for 30 kids, as surely we would have more, but not much more. 

On the first day of VBS, there were an astounding 50 kids who showed up! We were completely unprepared, and had to rush down to the co-op countless times to buy more supplies for the kids. With a team of only 6 people, it was very difficult to manage that many kids while getting the Message and the Gospel accross to them. Luckily, we were assisted by one of the LAMP representatives who was visiting the community, and one of the local community members who looked after some of the youngers.
