# Building a Raspberry Pi Radio Station

## Overview
This project involves creating a low-power radio station using a Raspberry Pi and a literal wire. The station broadcasts music and announcements within a small radius (~100 ft, but can be boosted with a better antenna), perfect for school events or local community use.

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (any model)
- Antenna (simple wire works)
- Power supply
- Audio source (USB sound card or GPIO)

## Software Setup
The station runs using a library (pifmrds) and can be enhanced by running python scripts to autogenerate a playlist based on music tracks and voice clips for announcements, or even advertisement. This project is still in the making
