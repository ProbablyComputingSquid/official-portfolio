            <p>I recently finished writing my resume, and decided that having a website would look good. My old website was just a few lines of black text on a white page that redirected to my pronouns.page. I needed to add some skills, projects, and qualifications to convince companies/organizations to hire me, because for all they know, I could just be some random bozo with none of the skills I claim to have. 
<br>
I&#39;ve started using cursor to make this website to see if it was as hyped out as it is by those influencers selling $50 get rich quick with cursor tutorials. I can&#39;t really criticize vibe coding without actually doing it. After finishing the first rough draft of this website, I&#39;ll write my takes on cursor in a new blog post, so stay tuned. 
<br>
Regarding actual content for these blogs and this web page, I have been hand-writing all of it, even if I am using generative AI tools to assist in writing code, I wouldn&#39;t sell my sould to openAI to write blog posts. I don&#39;t want to constribute to the AI slop bucket, or to the dead internet. If people wanted to read chatGPT, they would go straight to the source. And because all of this is my writing, be on the lookout for grammar mistakes, because I got a 86% on that unit in English :p. At least I know how to avoid comma splices now, but I tend to write how I speak which is problematic. 
<br>
Anyways, I&#39;ll keep it short and sweet, because nobody needs to read textwalls of yap.</p>
<p>See ya in the next one,<br>
